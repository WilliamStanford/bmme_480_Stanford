Options for class presentation

1. Logistic Regression

2. K Nearest Neighbor 
	- Started WS

3. Basic Neural Network 
	- copy and pasted code from lecture, needs simple adjustments 

4. Deep Artificial Neural Networks
	- Multiple options here 
		1. Kernel initializer 
		2. Activation function
		3. Batch Normalization 
		4. Regularization
		5. Optimization
		6. Learning schedules/rules

5. Dimensionality Reduction 
	- Started exploring with PCA, might be unnecessary

6. Convolutional Neural Network
	- Probably unnecessary
