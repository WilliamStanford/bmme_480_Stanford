  Thomas modified hello.txt for me
  
 HW2
  Created Kaggle Account and downloaded data set
  Explored dataset with Pandas and Jupyter notebook
  Plotted class vs fare
  Crosstabbed Survive with Pclass
  Built and submitted two models to Kaggle,
   one with a similar framework as the one reviewed in class but using passenger class and age instead of parch
   the second using this model but adding on the condition of setting survival equal to one if the passenger was in first    class or it was a passenger of age less than 10
  Pushed both notebook and pandas script to repository
